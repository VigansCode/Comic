BABEL
Real Name: Eliot Weiss
Alias: Babel
Occupation: Former linguistics professor, now vigilante
Appearance
A seemingly ordinary man transformed by his power, Babel's most striking feature is his eyes, which burn with intense golden energy when he speaks. His mouth appears unnaturally wide when fully opened, and faint yellow-orange fracture patterns spread across his face when he channels his abilities at full strength. He wears specialized headphones - not to enhance his power, but as a failsafe to prevent accidental activation when he's not in combat. His face shows signs of strain and premature aging, with cracks forming in his skin that glow when he uses his abilities intensively.
Powers: Cognitive Disruption Speech
Babel possesses the supernatural ability to speak in a "language" that directly interferes with neural processes. Key aspects include:

Thought scrambling: His words create confusion and disorientation in listeners
Power disruption: His speech interferes with the concentration needed for other metahumans to use their abilities
Sensory overload: Extended exposure causes sensory hallucinations and temporary synesthesia
Frequency modulation: Can target specific individuals in a crowd by subtly changing his vocal patterns
Self-protection: Partial immunity to mind control and telepathic attacks

Origin
Eliot was a brilliant linguistics professor researching ancient texts said to contain "words of power" when he discovered a previously untranslated manuscript. While attempting to pronounce the phonetic patterns, he experienced a seizure that lasted three days. When he awoke, the structure of his brain had been fundamentally altered, allowing him to speak in patterns that disrupt cognitive functions in others. The speech bubbles around him contain fragments of this impossible language - words that make no sense yet somehow overwhelm the mind's ability to process information.
Personality
Once an academic, Babel retains his analytical mind but has become more isolated due to the dangerous nature of his abilities. He speaks carefully and precisely in normal conversation, often choosing his words with extreme caution. His power has made him deeply aware of how language shapes reality, leading to a philosophical outlook on his abilities.
He struggles with the ethics of his power, knowing that extended exposure to his disruptive speech can cause lasting psychological trauma. This has led him to develop a code where he uses different "intensities" of his ability based on the threat level he faces.
His catchphrase, whispered before unleashing his full power: "Cover your ears. This will hurt."
