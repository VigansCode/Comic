BACKLASH
Real Name: Marcus Trent
Alias: Backlash
Occupation: Former military special forces, now independent hero/mercenary
Appearance
A powerfully built man with an imposing physique, his dark skin is lined with glowing golden cracks that pulse with absorbed energy. The more he's attacked, the brighter and more extensive these energy lines become, spreading across his body like a circuit board coming to life. He typically wears minimal armor—just enough to provide some initial protection—knowing that as a battle progresses, his own body becomes his best defense. The wrappings on his forearms serve as kinetic energy conductors, helping him focus and direct the power he absorbs.
Powers: Kinetic Adaptation
Backlash possesses the extraordinary ability to absorb the energy from any attack and convert it into enhanced strength, speed, and durability. Key aspects of his power include:

Attack absorption: Physical blows, energy blasts, and even sonic attacks fuel his power
Conversion efficiency: The more powerful the attack, the greater his power boost
Cumulative effect: Multiple attacks stack his power exponentially
Energy discharge: Can release stored energy in devastating counterattacks
Adaptation memory: His body "remembers" attacks and becomes more resistant to them over time

Origin
Marcus was a decorated soldier whose unit was ambushed during a covert operation in a region rumored to contain experimental weapons facilities. The explosion that should have killed him instead triggered a dormant metahuman gene, fusing his cellular structure with the energy from the blast. He awoke days later in the rubble, the sole survivor, as enemies continued to fire upon his position. With each bullet and blast, he felt stronger, eventually turning the tide against his attackers single-handedly.
Personality
Backlash carries himself with the disciplined confidence of his military background, but there's an edge of barely contained energy to his movements. He's strategically patient in battle, sometimes deliberately taking hits to power up for a decisive strike. Outside of combat, he's thoughtful and measured, aware that his power thrives on conflict and careful not to seek it unnecessarily.
He struggles with the paradoxical nature of his abilities—to protect others often means putting himself in harm's way, yet each attack makes him more dangerous and potentially destructive. This has led him to develop a strict personal code about how and when to use his powers.
His catchphrase: "Keep hitting. I'm just getting warmed up."
