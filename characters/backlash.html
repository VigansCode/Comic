                <h1>BACKLASH</h1>
                <p class="character-description">
                    A powerfully built man with an imposing physique, Marcus Trent stands apart in any crowd due to the distinctive golden cracks that pulse beneath his dark skin. These luminous energy pathways intensify with every attack he absorbs, spreading across his body like a living circuit board coming to life. As a former military special forces operative turned independent hero-mercenary, Backlash wears minimal armor—just enough to provide initial protection—knowing that as battle progresses, his own energized body becomes his greatest defense. The specialized wrappings on his forearms serve as kinetic energy conductors, allowing him to focus and redirect the power he absorbs with devastating precision. With each blow he takes, the golden light emanating from his body grows brighter, a warning to his enemies that their attacks are only making him stronger.

                <h3>Backstory:</h3>
                <p>Marcus Trent was a decorated soldier whose distinguished military career took a life-altering turn during a covert operation in a region rumored to contain experimental weapons facilities. His unit was ambushed, and the resulting explosion should have killed him instantly. Instead, the blast triggered a dormant metahuman gene within Marcus, fusing his cellular structure with the energy released in the explosion. He awoke days later in the rubble as the sole survivor, with enemies still firing upon his position. With each bullet and blast that struck him, Marcus felt a surge of strength and power coursing through his body. The more they attacked, the stronger he became, eventually turning the tide against his attackers single-handedly. After returning home, he found himself unable to readjust to civilian life, and his new abilities made him a person of interest to various government agencies. Rather than becoming a military asset again, Marcus chose independence, taking the name "Backlash" and using his unique abilities to work as a hero-for-hire, taking on missions that align with his strong moral code while maintaining his freedom.</p>
