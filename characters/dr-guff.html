                <h1>DR GUFF</h1>
                <p class="character-description">
                    Once a brilliant and compassionate scientist, Dr. Guff's life took a dark turn when his beloved son fell gravely ill. Desperate to find a cure, he pushed the boundaries of medical science, conducting increasingly dangerous experiments. In a tragic twist of fate, his final attempt at creating a miracle cure went catastrophically wrong, resulting in a devastating infection that spread through the city. The incident not only failed to save his son but also twisted Dr. Guff's mind, transforming him from a loving father into a maniacal scientist obsessed with spreading his "creation" to others. Now, he sees the infection not as a failure, but as a twisted gift to humanity, believing that only through collective suffering can true evolution occur.

                <h3>Backstory:</h3>
                <p>Dr. Guff was once the city's most renowned medical researcher, known for his groundbreaking work in genetic therapy. His world shattered when his young son was diagnosed with a rare, terminal illness. Working tirelessly in his private lab, he developed an experimental treatment using advanced viral engineering. The desperate attempt to save his son resulted in a catastrophic accident, creating a highly contagious pathogen that quickly spread through the research facility. His son, being patient zero, was lost in the initial outbreak. The trauma of losing his son, combined with exposure to the virus, fractured Dr. Guff's psyche. He now believes that his "gift" will force humanity to evolve through suffering, seeing himself not as a villain, but as the architect of human evolution.</p>
