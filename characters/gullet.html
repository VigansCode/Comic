                <p class="character-description">
                    A towering behemoth of crimson skin and molten fury, Gullet stands as one of the most physically imposing figures in the criminal underworld. At 7'2", his massive frame is covered in a network of glowing cracks that pulse with orange-yellow light, like magma flowing beneath the earth's crust. His most distinctive feature is his grotesquely wide jaw that can unhinge like a snake's to consume objects several times larger than a normal mouth could handle. The heavy gold chains draped around his neck—trophies taken from defeated enemies—remain unmelted despite the intense heat his body generates. Once known as Damon Forge, a dedicated steel mill worker, he now serves as a feared enforcer and mercenary, brought in when impossible obstacles need to be removed—literally consumed. His perpetual hunger drives him forward, always seeking more exotic and dangerous materials to feed his internal furnace. Before every battle, he announces his arrival with his signature growl: "Time to feed the furnace!"

                <h3>Backstory:</h3>
                <p>Damon Forge was once nothing more than a hardworking steel mill employee with fifteen years of dedicated service. His life changed forever during a catastrophic accident when experimental metal-bonding chemicals exploded in the foundry. While his colleagues perished instantly, Damon's body somehow fused with the molten metal and volatile chemicals, transforming him at the molecular level. Rescue workers found him unconscious but seemingly unharmed in the center of the devastation. After weeks in a coma, he awoke with an insatiable hunger, instinctively reaching for and consuming the metal fixtures around his hospital bed. Horrified doctors watched as his skin turned crimson and began to crack, revealing the molten energy now flowing through his veins. As his transformation completed, Damon discovered that consuming inorganic materials—especially metals—made him stronger and temporarily satisfied his never-ending hunger. Abandoned by the mill owners who feared liability, he embraced his new identity as "Gullet" and turned to mercenary work where his unique abilities would be valued rather than feared. Despite his monstrous appearance and brutal methods, he maintains a crude code of honor, refusing to harm children and consuming only the weapons of his enemies, not the enemies themselves—though his terrifying threats often suggest otherwise.</p>
