                <h1>KISMET</h1>
                <p class="character-description">
                    With ethereal white hair that seems to float as if touched by an unseen current, Kismet commands attention wherever she goes. Her piercing blue eyes contain faint, shimmering patterns that resemble neural pathways, giving her gaze an otherworldly quality that few can maintain contact with for long. The small diamond-shaped birthmark on her forehead isn't a decoration but a natural marking that glows subtly when she accesses the full extent of her telepathic abilities. The intricate necklace she wears contains ancient symbols that help her focus and control her overwhelming mental powers. As Elara Noor, she was once a valuable intelligence operative, but as Kismet, she now works as an independent consultant, offering her unique insights to those she deems worthy of her talents. Her composed demeanor masks the constant mental effort required to filter the thoughts of those around her, and she often speaks with careful precision, occasionally pausing mid-sentence as unsolicited information flows into her consciousness. Her catchphrase encapsulates her worldview: "Thoughts never lie, even when words do."

                <h3>Backstory:</h3>
                <p>Born during a rare celestial alignment that occurs once every millennium, Elara Noor's extraordinary abilities began manifesting in early childhood when she started responding to questions no one had asked aloud. Her concerned but protective parents sought help from an ancient order of mystics who recognized her gift as one prophesied in their texts. These mentors taught her meditation techniques and mental exercises to control the constant barrage of thoughts flooding her mind. Under their guidance, she learned to separate her own consciousness from the mental voices of others and to build protective barriers that allowed her to function in society. After mastering her abilities, Elara was recruited by government intelligence agencies eager to utilize her talents for national security. For years, she served loyally, helping to prevent numerous threats by reading the minds of suspects and identifying hidden dangers. However, her unwavering moral compass led her to discover that her handlers were using information she provided for increasingly questionable purposes, including blackmail and political manipulation. Disillusioned, she orchestrated her own extraction, using her knowledge of classified operations as leverage to secure her freedom. Now operating as Kismet, she carefully chooses her clients and causes, using her powers to expose corruption, reunite missing persons with their families, and occasionally assist law enforcement with particularly heinous casesâ€”but always on her terms and according to her strict personal code of ethics.</p>
