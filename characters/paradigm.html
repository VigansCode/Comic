PARADIGM
Real Name: Victor Lenz
Alias: Paradigm
Occupation: Former black hat hacker, now underground power broker
Origin
Victor Lenz was once the most elusive cybercriminal on three continents, specializing in complex social engineering attacks that manipulated victims into compromising their own security. His signature method wasn't brute-forcing systems but rather crafting elaborate deceptions that made targets willingly hand over access.
His decade-long crime spree ended when a rival hacker set him up, leading to his capture and imprisonment in a maximum-security facility. During his third year of incarceration, he was selected for an experimental rehabilitation program testing neurological treatments designed to reduce criminal tendencies. Unknown to Victor, the prison had partnered with a private security firm using inmates as test subjects for perception-altering technology intended for crowd control.
The procedure went catastrophically wrong when Victor's unique neural structure reacted abnormally to the treatment. Instead of making him more compliant, it fused the experimental tech with his brain's visual processing centers. He discovered his new abilities when guards suddenly began fighting each other during a routine transfer, seeing one another as escaping prisoners.
Rise to Power
Victor orchestrated his escape by creating facility-wide confusion, making guards perceive inmates as colleagues and actual colleagues as dangerous insurgents. He disappeared into the criminal underground, spending months learning to control his newfound ability to manipulate perception.
He constructed his distinctive armor using components stolen from the same company that had experimented on him, with the circular devices serving as amplifiers for his neural projections. The yellow-green color scheme was deliberately chosen to enhance the disorienting effect of his powers.
Powers and Abilities
Paradigm's Reversed Vision power gives him unparalleled control over perception:

Makes enemies see their allies as immediate threats
Disguises actual dangers as harmless or enticing
Can affect multiple targets simultaneously
His mental manipulations persist for hours after exposure
Exceptional psychological insight from years of social engineering
Extensive knowledge of security protocols and human behavior patterns

Personality
Paradigm approaches every situation like a complex hack, looking for the vulnerabilities in group dynamics and exploiting them with surgical precision. He speaks with the confident authority of someone who knows exactly how systems—both technological and social—can be compromised.
He takes particular pleasure in turning structured organizations against themselves, seeing it as poetic justice for his years of imprisonment. Unlike physical powerhouses, he wins through manipulation rather than confrontation, often eliminating threats without ever being perceived as one himself.
His prison experience left him with a deep distrust of authority and a belief that most human relationships are based on flawed perceptions rather than reality. He considers his power not as a supernatural ability but simply as the most advanced form of the social engineering he always practiced.
His catchphrase: "Trust your eyes? That's your first mistake."
