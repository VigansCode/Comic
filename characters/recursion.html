RECURSION
Real Name: Commander Jackson Reeves
Alias: Recursion
Occupation: Special forces operative, temporal agent
Appearance
A hardened military operative with the weathered face of someone who has seen countless battles—because he literally has. His tactical vest contains a central pocket watch-like device labeled "deaths" that tracks the number of times he's been killed in action, with faint scars across his body that correspond to fatal wounds from previous lives. His eyes hold the weary knowledge of someone who has experienced his own demise multiple times. The ghostly images of his past iterations visible behind him represent previous versions that have been "uploaded" and replaced after falling in combat.
Powers: Quantum Upload
Recursion possesses the extraordinary ability to create backup copies of his consciousness and physical form that activate upon his death. Key aspects include:

Death contingency: Upon dying, his consciousness transfers to a waiting backup body
Retained memories: Each new version remembers everything up to the moment of death
Strategic advantage: Can use knowledge of failed attempts to adjust tactics
Limited resources: Can only maintain a finite number of backup copies at once
Temporal anchoring: Each backup exists slightly out of phase with normal reality until needed

Origin
Jackson was a decorated special forces commander leading a raid on a rogue scientist's laboratory when he was caught in an explosion involving experimental quantum technology. Instead of dying, he awakened in an identical body with complete memories of his death, discovering that the accident had somehow imprinted his consciousness into the quantum field. The pocket watch device he wears isn't the source of his power but rather a counter that helps him track how many "lives" he has expended—a psychological anchor to maintain his sanity through multiple deaths and resurrections.
Personality
Recursion approaches every situation with methodical precision and uncanny calmness in the face of danger. Having experienced death repeatedly, he has developed both an appreciation for life and a strategic detachment that makes him willing to sacrifice current versions of himself for mission success. He maintains a dark, sardonic sense of humor about his condition, often making remarks about "trying again" when missions go poorly.
He struggles with existential questions about identity and continuity—is he still the same person after dozens of deaths and uploads? This philosophical burden is balanced by his unwavering commitment to protecting others from experiencing the death he has come to know so intimately.
His catchphrase: "Death is just a chance to try again with better intel."
