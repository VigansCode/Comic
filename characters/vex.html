                <h1>VEX MALTHORNE</h1>
                <p class="character-description">
                    A rugged, battle-scarred bounty hunter with a technological edge, Vex Malthorne stalks the neon-lit streets with cold precision. Known for his unique blend of old-world tactics and cutting-edge tech, Vex tracks targets that no one else can find. His signature long, tattered trench coat—embedded with advanced tech—has become his calling card in the criminal underworld. With half his face concealed behind a cracked metallic mask, his single visible eye holds the intensity of a predator who's seen too much of humanity's darkness. His bionic arm, a custom piece with exposed wiring and an integrated energy blaster, serves as both a reminder of what he's lost and a tool for what he must do. Operating in the shadows between law and street justice, Vex has built a reputation as a man who always completes his contracts—no matter the cost.

                <h3>Backstory:</h3>
                <p>Once a decorated law enforcement officer in an elite crime division, Vex Malthorne's life changed forever when a high-stakes raid on a tech-smuggling operation went catastrophically wrong. Double-crossed by someone within his own department, Vex was ambushed, severely injured, and left for dead. He lost his arm, part of his face, and his faith in the system he'd sworn to uphold. After months of painful recovery, he emerged a different man—rebuilt with experimental technologies that the department disavowed any knowledge of. Cast out from the force and haunted by unanswered questions, Vex now works as an independent bounty hunter, using his intimate knowledge of both law enforcement and criminal operations to track down high-value targets. His true mission, however, remains finding those responsible for his betrayal. Each contract brings him closer to uncovering the conspiracy that destroyed his old life, while his technological enhancements—constantly upgraded with black market tech—increasingly blur the line between man and machine.</p>
